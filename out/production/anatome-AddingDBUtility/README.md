##### the student well-being toolkit

this repository provides source control for our stage 2 computing science team project.

---
###the gist:

######what is it?
our app provides information highlighting key areas of student well-being, in accompaniment of therapeutic interactive widgets.
futhermore, it provides the nearest help service a conduit to its users, allowing them to plug their own information and structural services, chiefly implemented by an information space, tips provided for each section, and a booking system for appointments.

######who is it for?
our app is for new university students, and bridges the gap for them between their issues and their solutions. this therefore encompasses a back-end provided abstractly for organisations, as a pitching tool.

###group etiquette:

guidelines:
* don't break git - if you have an idea but you're not sure if it'll work, fork it!
* remember to commit when you've done some work so we can all see it
* keep your code well commented and structured so we can use everything without re-doing it

commenting:
*we are marked intricately for consistency across our project. therefore, there are things we need to enforce, like a way of commenting! we should use [javadoc's model throughout](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html#format), as it is the most useful.*
```javascript
/* 
 * description of the function
 * 
 * @param  par  describe the parameter
 * @return      describe what returns
 * @see         provide a reference is necessary
 */
 public int myFunc(Param par) {
    return 0;
 }
```
